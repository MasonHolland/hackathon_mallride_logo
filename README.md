### Setup

So this is going to be kind of a rough setup. We found [fastLED](http://fastled.io/) to be the best resource for our LED setup. We were playing around extensively with creating a pallet and trying to just get the image of the bus displayed across the app. We did not get this far. We just attempted to use one of the provided examples to build from, the one we played around with the most was the ColorPalette directory. You have to copy most of the contents of the main folder into one of the examples for it to build to the device. I would recommend spinning up one of the other examples to ensure you are seeing the lights as expected. Don't have much else to offer, our code is kind of a shit show and sadly I don't think we have much for you guys to go off of. We attempted to create a pallete that corresponds to each individual LED and this is where we finshed, however the pallet it limited to 16 entries, so I had to break this out into 8 seperate pallets. It's gross and I don't think it's worth pursuing. 

Sorry
